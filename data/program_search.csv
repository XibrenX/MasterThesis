31,Out of 59 submissions, in order to comply with the intended spirit and the novelty of ETAPS as an event of federated conferences, after some discussion within the PC, three rerouted to ESOP and two to FoSSACS. Then, after a rigorous refereeing process, followed by an intensive, ten-days-long, electronic selection meeting, 18 were selected for presentation and are included in this volume,which also includes two invited papers and three presentations of demos. The first invited paper is by Kent Beck, one of the two invited speakers on behalf of the overall ETAPS'98 (the other being Amir Pnueli). His contribu- tion is a much shortened version of a manifesto he had in mind on what he calls Extreme Programming, a discipline of software development emphasizing productivity, flexibility, informality, teamwork and limited use of technology outside programming. Following the author's rather dialecticM wishes, I wel- come its inclusion in these proceedings, because, first of all, a much broader and more dialectical view of the software production process is very well in the spirit
